1.0  Intro
---------------------------------------------------------

Tetra is a Tetris clone written for the Windows OS.  I wrote it because the other Tetris-clones out there didn't adhere to the same parameters that are found in the Tetris games for the NES and Gameboy console systems, which I consider still to be the best versions of Tetris.  Tetra is designed to be an almost exact duplicate of the original Tetris, although there are some noteable changes (mostly cosmetic; I did add a little flair of my own:)

2.0  Tetra Features
---------------------------------------------------------

The gameplay is just like Tetris; the blocks move side to side, they can be dropped faster by the player, rotated both clockwise and counter-clockwise, etc.  Clickable pause, reset, and quit buttons assist in game play, and there is, of course, a high score system so you can compete against yourself or those who dare challenge you.  You can also do the following:
	* Change the background music, or turn it off
	* Turn sound effects on and off
	* Change the look of the blocks; there are 5 
  	  different types
	* Hide or show the Next piece
	* Change the keyboard controls to suit your playing 
	  style
	* Changes are remembered for future game play


---------------------------------------------------------
3.0  Installation

Basically, this game is freeware.  If you try to make money off it, you will get in trouble.  But you can distribute it for free. If you feel so inclined, you can send Alexey Pazhitnov some money as thanks for his brilliant contribution to the gaming world.  As for me, I'm content with just completing it and having something to play on the computer.  I still have my Gameboy Tetris, but that doesn't look very appropriate when I'm at work! :)

The MIDI music files were downloaded from 	www.mindlick.com/tetris/media/music/music.htm

Sound files were free from all over the Internet, and 1 or 2 of them are from the Windows Space Cadet pinball game.

The Zerohour font is freeware, found once again on the internet.

The artwork is all mine.  I did it all in MS Paint (boy, what a program.)  I don't care if you use it, but if I can do it from scratch, then trust me, so can you.

The code for the game is mine as well.  For all I care, you can modify it, change it, delete it, rename it, do whatever you want with it and ship it off in your own program.  After all, at some point or another we're all using code that somebody else has written, right?  Windows API functions don't make themselves.  Since I'm not selling the game it's really no big deal.  But if you do decide to use my wonderful code, put my name somewhere in your credits or acknowledgements, and I'll be happy, because I'll know my fame is spreading throughout the world.  The caveat to the aforementioned is that if you do manage to get rich by using something I wrote, and your money-making product doesn't infringe on the Tetris copyrights, I will share in the profits with you, assuming it's all on the up and up, no black market stuff for me. :)

Before I go, I must do what I say and thank Simon Price for inspiration for the BitmapBuffer class.  I don't know how you get in touch with him, but you can find programs he has written on VB websites like www.vbexplorer.com.  Smart guy.
